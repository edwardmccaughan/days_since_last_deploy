days_since_last_Deploy
======================

take a git repo that uses deploy tags to mark production deploys and print out the number of days since the last deploy

tags need to be in the format "production_deploy_2013_09_30-14_04"

you'll have to look at the code to figure out what gems need installed, eg the git gem.
